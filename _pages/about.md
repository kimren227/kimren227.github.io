I am currently a Ph.D student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Zheng Jianmin (NTU)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asjmzheng/) and [Prof. Cai Jianfei (Monash University)](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianfei-cai). I'm under the [Indistrial Post-Graduate Program (IPP)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/graduate-college/admissions/programme/industrial-postgraduate-programme-(ipp)), which is a joint program between SenseTime and NTU initiated by Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).

I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from NTU in 2018. During my undergraduate study, I was interested in High-Performance-Computing(HPC) and privileged to represented NTU to compete with other top universities around the globe in the [International Supercomputer Conference (ISC) Student Cluster Competetion](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntu-team-breaks-captcha-system-for-global-award) in Frankfurt, Germany, and [ACM/IEEE Supercomputer Conference (SC) Student Cluster Competetion](http://sc16.supercomputing.org/2016/11/02/singaporenanyangscc-student-cluster-competition-team-enigma-nanyang-technological-university-singapore/index.html) in Salt Lake City, USA.

Prior to my Ph.D, I was a software engineer in Autodesk working on large-scale 3D Reconstruction Engine ([Autodesk ReCap Photo](https://www.autodesk.com.sg/products/recap/overview)) including Structure-from-Motion (SFM), Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) and Surface Reconstruction from 2017 to 2020.

My research interests and past experiences include Multiview Reconstruction(camera calibration, pointcloud, mesh and texture reconstruction from multiview RGB or Kinect-RGBD), Shape Parsing (turing rastered 3D data into parametric CAD shapes), physically based rendering and differentiable rendering (via ray tracing or volumetric rendering but not rasterzation) and 3D computer vision and graphics in general.
