I am currently a Principal Software Development Engineer at Autodesk and a Ph.D. student in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am supervised by [Prof. Zheng Jianmin (NTU)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asjmzheng/) and [Prof. Cai Jianfei (Monash University)](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianfei-cai). I was previously part of the [Indistrial Post-Graduate Program (IPP)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/graduate-college/admissions/programme/industrial-postgraduate-programme-(ipp)), a joint initiative between SenseTime and NTU under the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).

I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from NTU in 2018. During my undergraduate study, I was interested in High-Performance-Computing(HPC) and privileged to represented NTU to compete with other top universities around the globe in the [International Supercomputer Conference (ISC) Student Cluster Competetion](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntu-team-breaks-captcha-system-for-global-award) in Frankfurt, Germany, and [ACM/IEEE Supercomputer Conference (SC) Student Cluster Competetion](http://sc16.supercomputing.org/2016/11/02/singaporenanyangscc-student-cluster-competition-team-enigma-nanyang-technological-university-singapore/index.html) in Salt Lake City, USA.

Prior to my Ph.D, I was a software engineer in Autodesk working on large-scale 3D Reconstruction Engine ([Autodesk ReCap Photo](https://www.autodesk.com.sg/products/recap/overview)) including Structure-from-Motion (SFM), Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) and Surface Reconstruction from 2017 to 2020.

My research interests and past experiences include multi-view reconstruction (camera calibration, point cloud, mesh, and texture reconstruction from multi-view RGB or Kinect-RGBD), shape parsing (turning rasterized 3D data into parametric CAD shapes), differentiable rendering, and, more broadly, 3D computer vision and graphics.
